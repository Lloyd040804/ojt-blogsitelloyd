        <h3>Journal Summary</h3>
        <p>
          My On-the-Job Training (OJT) at TESDA was a meaningful experience that allowed 
          me to apply my academic knowledge in real workplace settings. I was mainly 
          assigned in handling CACs documents where I was responsible for organizing, 
          filing, and assisting in the processing of important records. This task helped 
          me develop a sense of accuracy, patience, and responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aside from document-related tasks, I was also able to observe and support 
          office operations, communicate with staff, and assist in day-to-day activities. 
          These experiences improved my communication skills, teamwork, and adaptability 
          in a professional environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, the OJT allowed me to grow both personally and professionally. 
          I learned the importance of discipline, efficiency, and collaboration. 
          Most importantly, it boosted my confidence in preparing for my future career 
          in the IT field and gave me a better understanding of what it is like 
          to be part of a professional workforce.
